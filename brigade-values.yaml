# This is the main configuration file for the Brigade chart.
# To override values here, specify them in your own YAML file, and override
# during install or upgrade:
#
#    $ helm install -n brigade -f myValues.yaml brigade/brigade
#
# By default, the chart will install with RBAC. To install without
# RBAC, set `rbac.enabled` to `false`.
#
# To enable the GitHub gateway, set `brigade-github-app.enabled` to `true`.
# See brigadecore/brigade-gitub-app for steps to setup a Github App and add its configuration
# to the sub-chart section below.
#
# Advanced Configuration
#
# Developers may wish to override the location of Docker images. For each
# deployment, `registry` controls the image registry, and `name` controls
# the image name. If unspecified, the Chart.yaml's appVersion field will be
# used to pull the tag. If you override the `tag` value, that version will
# be used instead.
#
# Note that when `rbac.enabled` is turned on, as is the default, the chart will
# install a set of RBAC objects that are designed to give a moderate set of
# permissions to the Brigade core components. However, even if RBACs are not
# enabled, this chart will create service accounts for each entity that we
# install. Security experts may prefer to apply their own RBACs instead of the
# ones supplied by the chart.  Provided that the service accounts remain the
# same, this chart should provide compatibility with custom rules.
